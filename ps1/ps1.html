          I believe it's priced a little bit on the higher side but still it's
          better than its competitors. Display is less bright than I hoped, with
          okayish resolution.

          I have put it on 'Performance boost' 24/7 mode which reduces battery
          life but it does feel a bit more snappy and fast. It doesn't feel
          premium in the hand but it's '4 camera layout' tricks others that it's
          a Rs12000+ phone; atleast from afar.

          This mobile is purely for normal use, I don't recommend this for heavy
          users.

          Camera is ok. The battery is really working good and long lasting.
          Samsung could have given a better processor. I will recommend to
          choose other mobile in this price range according to processor.
          Otherwise everything is ok ok.

          PROS: 1.Design is best at price of 7k and 4 64 with fingerprint
        </div>
        <div class="wp">
          2.Display is acceptable (it's a long phone) 3. Battery life is around
          9hours but You need to disable some important settings of Google and
          MIUI You can visit TECHNOBUZZNET channel to disable miui and Google
          tracker It would increase performance and battery backup so much now I
          get around 12 hours
